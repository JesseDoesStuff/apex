title: More Information on High-Altitude Balloons
---

High-altitude balloons (HABs) are unmanned balloons designed to carry payloads (such as cameras, sensors, or experiments) into the stratosphere, typically reaching altitudes of 18–37 km (60,000–120,000 feet). They are used for scientific research, weather monitoring, amateur radio, and even space exploration simulations.

### **Why They Matter**

High-altitude balloons are a cost-effective way to conduct experiments and observations in near-space environments. They are used for:

- Weather and climate research  
- Testing space-bound instruments  
- Amateur photography and exploration  
- Educational outreach and STEM projects  

Whether you’re a student, researcher, or hobbyist, high-altitude ballooning offers a unique opportunity to explore the stratosphere and contribute to scientific discovery.
