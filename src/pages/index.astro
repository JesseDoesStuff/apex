        <Dropdown question="What's a hackathon?">
          A hackathon is a 12-48 hour event where groups of people can get
          together and create! Don't worry, we're not doing any computer
          hacking. This hackathon is a bit unorthodox - it's a 3 month long
          journey, culminating in the traditional 48 hour event, but with some
          twists.
        </Dropdown>

        <Dropdown question="Who's this for?">
          This is for any high schooler or middle schooler 18 or under who's
          interested in working on a large project. Reaching out of you comfort
          zone is necessary! If you've ever wanted to branch into the world of
          hardware, this is perfect for you. Or maybe, you just want to switch
          things up a little.
          <br />
          Don't worry if you don't have any experience - most people don't! We'll
          help you along the way if you need it.
        </Dropdown>

        <Dropdown question="Do I need a team?">
          Yes, you need a team of 3-4 people. This is because we have limited
          space on the balloon, and we want to make sure everyone gets a chance
          to launch their project. If you don't have a team, don't worry! We'll
          help you find one.
        </Dropdown>

        <Dropdown question="Do I need experience to sign up?">
          Nope! Apex is open to all teenagers interested in launching projects
          on high altitude balloons. We will provide lots of resources to help
          you along the way of creating your project, in addition to weekly
          working calls to refine your idea and help you build.
        </Dropdown>

        <Dropdown question="What's a high altitude balloon?">
          High altitude balloons (HABs) are an accessible way to send research
          and recreational payloads into altitudes upwards of 100,000 feet.
          While they demand meticulous planning and logistics, they reward those
          who launch them with the chance to send their payloads to tremendous
          altitudes. We are here to bring you that experience, but without the
          fierce logistics and infrastructure that often come with a launch!
