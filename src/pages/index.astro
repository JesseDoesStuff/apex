        <Dropdown question="What's a hackathon?">
          A hackathon is a 12-48 hour event where groups of people can get
          together and create! Don't worry, we're not doing any computer
          hacking. This hackathon is a bit unorthodox - it's a 3 month long
          journey, culminating in the traditional 48 hour event, but with some
          twists.
        </Dropdown>

        <Dropdown question="Who's this for?">
          This is for any high schooler or middle schooler 18 or under who's
          interested in working on a large project. Reaching out of you comfort
          zone is necessary! If you've ever wanted to branch into the world of
          hardware, this is perfect for you. Or maybe, you just want to switch
          things up a little.
          <br />
          <br />
          Don't worry if you don't have any experience - most people don't! We'll
          help you along the way if you need it.
        </Dropdown>

        <Dropdown question="Do I need experience to sign up?">
          Nope! Apex is open to all teenagers interested in launching projects
          on high altitude balloons. We will provide lots of resources to help
          you along the way of creating your project, in addition to weekly
          working calls to refine your idea and help you build.
        </Dropdown>

        <Dropdown question="Do I need a team?">
          Yes, you need a team of 3-4 people. This is because we have limited
          space on the balloon, and we want to make sure everyone gets a chance
          to launch their project. If you don't have a team, don't worry! We'll
          help you find one.
        </Dropdown>

        <Dropdown question="Is this free?">
          Yes, this is completely free! We want to make sure that everyone has
          the opportunity to participate, regardless of their financial
          situation. We'll cover the cost of the launch, food, a project budget,
          and flights.
        </Dropdown>

        <h1 class="mt-10 w-1/2 text-2xl">Logistics</h1>

        <Dropdown question="Where and when is this happening?">
          The main event will hopefully be hosted at the WPS Institute, in
          Newton, MA, just outside of Boston. The event will take place from
          June 20-22, 2025. See a full schedule <a
            class="underline"
            href="/resources/launch">here</a
          >!
        </Dropdown>

        <Dropdown question="Wait - we need to track our time spent working?">
          You sure do! To verify that you're actually doing work for the event,
          we require you to track your time spent creating, coding, and
          researching.
        </Dropdown>

        <Dropdown question="Hold up, how do I track my time?">
          Great question! We're still working on the tool (expected by early
          March!), but it will record your screen while you work on your
          project. If you're working on something physical, you can set up your
          phone or other device to record yourself working. This way, we can
          verify that you're actually working on your project.
        </Dropdown>

        <Dropdown question="Is there a project budget?">
          Yep! Every person on a team that works for more than 20 hours will get
          $100. This means a team could get between $300 and $400!
        </Dropdown>

        <Dropdown question="How do we get there? Are flights free?">
          Once you reach your 100 hours of work, we'll cover the cost of your
          airfare or transport to Boston up to $400! In addition, we'll cover up
          to $40 worth of transport to and from the airport.
        </Dropdown>

        <h1 class="mt-10 w-1/2 text-2xl">Technical questions</h1>

        <Dropdown question="What's a high altitude balloon?">
          High altitude balloons (HABs) are an accessible way to send research
          and recreational payloads into altitudes upwards of 100,000 feet.
          While they demand meticulous planning and logistics, they reward those
          who launch them with the chance to send their payloads to tremendous
          altitudes. We are here to bring you that experience, but without the
          fierce logistics and infrastructure that often come with a launch!
          <br />

          >.
        </Dropdown>

        <Dropdown question="What can I launch?">
          You can launch anything that fits within our <a
            class="underline"
            href="/resources/limitations">limitations</a
          >! Bear in mind that we'll be vetting projects based on their
          complexity and the estimated time it will take.
        </Dropdown>

        <Dropdown question="Are the projects actually going to space?">
          Great question! Unfortunately, no. The balloons will reach altitudes
          of 100,000 feet (30 km), but they won't actually reach space. Your
          project will get to about 3/8 of the way to space.
        </Dropdown>

        <Dropdown question="Where can I learn more about balloons?">
          We have a <a class="underline" href="/resources/balloons">page</a>
          with more information about balloons.
