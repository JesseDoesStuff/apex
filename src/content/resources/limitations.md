We're open to projects of all types, but please keep your designs within these
limitations. Your project may not be allowed to fly if it does not conform to
these limitations.

- No RF near infrastructure frequencies (432.xx) MHz
- Under 0.25lbs in weight, not including the box (subject to change)
- Uses a self-sourced Stryofoam box
- Room for vinyl tubing to go through for payload mounting (see WIP model)

**Your proposal must be approved by the Apex team!**
