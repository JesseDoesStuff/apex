title: Project Limitations
---

We're open to projects of all types, but please keep your designs within these
limitations. Your project will **NOT** be allowed to fly if it does not conform to
these limitations.

- No RF near infrastructure frequencies (432.xx) MHz
- Under 0.5lbs in weight, including the box
- Uses a self-sourced Stryofoam box
- Room for 3/8" vinyl tubing to go all the way through the center of the enclosure for payload mounting

See this [basic CAD model](/rigging.step) to understand how your project will
fit onto the Apex balloon.

**Your proposal must be approved by the Apex team!**
