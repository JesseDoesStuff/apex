title: Building Details

_Please get your proposal approved by following the instructions in
[the proposal guide](/resources/proposal) before continuing on this page._

Now that your proposal has been approved, it's time to get started with building
your project! First, double-check the [limitations](/resources/limitations) so
that your project will be able to fly at Apex.

The primary resource for building your project is this YouTube video from
Colorado Space Grant:

**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuSQPtRbDGA**

Please watch that video to understand how to properly build your project. Here's
a few additional notes:

- See
  [this resource from Colorado Space Grant](https://www.colorado.edu/spaceminor/sites/default/files/attached-files/foamcore_.pdf)
  for information on building your project box.
- Make sure that your project (whether it be a PCB or plastic box) is properly
  mounted to the styrofoam box. This will ensure that it does not come loose in
  the box or shake too much. An acceptable way of doing this is by hot gluing
  your project onto standoffs embedded in the box, but you may use any way that
  works.
- Temperatures during flight can get as low as -50Â°F! It can also fluctuate
  rapidly enough to cause expansions and contractions in PCBs made from FR-4.
- Air pressure at 100,000ft is only 1% of that at sea level (around 10mb).
- Remember the [limitations](/resources/limitations)!

**You should start building your project by May 1st to allow for shipping to Apex
before the launch. Details on shipping your project and the launch are on the
[launch info page](/resources/launch).**

Again, if you have any questions, ask in the
[#apex](https://apexhacks.org/slack-channel) channel on the Hack Club Slack!
